# Low-Level Design (LLD) Document for Uber-like Platform

## 1. High-Level Overview

The goal of this design is to create an Uber-like ride-hailing platform that efficiently handles a sudden surge in cab demand from a particular location while ensuring system scalability, reliability, and real-time responsiveness.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Users should be able to request a ride.
- Drivers should be able to accept ride requests.
- The system should efficiently match drivers with nearby riders.
- Dynamic pricing should be applied based on demand.
- Location tracking should be available for both users and drivers.
- Real-time ride updates and status notifications.
- Support for ride cancellations.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** The system should handle sudden surges in traffic.
- **Low Latency:** Matching and ride confirmation should happen in real-time.
- **Reliability:** No single point of failure; should be fault-tolerant.
- **Consistency:** Ensure data consistency across distributed systems.
- **Availability:** The system should be highly available even under high loads.
- **Security:** User and driver data should be encrypted and stored securely.

## 3. API Design

### 3.1 Ride Request API

```http
POST /ride/request
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "user_id": "U12345",
  "pickup_location": { "lat": 37.7749, "long": -122.4194 },
  "destination": { "lat": 37.7849, "long": -122.4094 },
  "ride_type": "standard"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "ride_id": "R98765",
  "estimated_time": 5,
  "driver_id": "D54321",
  "vehicle": "Tesla Model 3",
  "eta": "5 min"
}
```

### 3.2 Driver Accept API

```http
POST /ride/accept
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "ride_id": "R98765",
  "driver_id": "D54321"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "estimated_arrival_time": "5 min"
}
```

### 3.3 Dynamic Pricing API

```http
GET /pricing/surge?location=37.7749,-122.4194
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "surge_multiplier": 1.5
}
```

## 4. Database Schema

### 4.1 Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR UNIQUE,
    rating FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 4.2 Drivers Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Drivers (
    driver_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    vehicle VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('available', 'on_trip', 'offline') DEFAULT 'available',
    location GEOMETRY,
    rating FLOAT
);
```

### 4.3 Rides Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Rides (
    ride_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    driver_id VARCHAR REFERENCES Drivers(driver_id),
    pickup_location GEOMETRY,
    destination GEOMETRY,
    status ENUM('requested', 'accepted', 'completed', 'cancelled') DEFAULT 'requested',
    surge_multiplier FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 Key Components

1. **API Gateway**: Manages API requests and routes them appropriately.
2. **Ride Matching Service**: Matches riders with nearby available drivers.
3. **Surge Pricing Service**: Dynamically adjusts ride prices based on demand.
4. **Location Tracking Service**: Continuously updates driver and rider locations.
5. **Notification Service**: Sends real-time updates to users and drivers.
6. **Database & Caching Layer**: Stores persistent data and leverages Redis for quick lookups.

### 5.2 High-Level Workflow

1. User requests a ride via the mobile app.
2. The request is sent to the API gateway.
3. The Ride Matching Service finds the nearest available driver.
4. The Dynamic Pricing Service calculates surge pricing if applicable.
5. The selected driver receives a ride request notification.
6. Once accepted, real-time tracking starts.
7. Upon ride completion, the fare is calculated, and payment is processed.

## 6. Handling Sudden Surge in Demand

- **Pre-emptive Load Balancing:** Distribute ride requests across multiple backend services.
- **Geofencing & Demand Prediction:** Identify high-demand areas in advance using machine learning.
- **Surge Pricing Mechanism:** Encourage more drivers to be available in high-demand areas.
- **Caching & Rate Limiting:** Use Redis/Memcached to cache frequent requests and prevent API abuse.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Use cloud-based auto-scaling strategies to handle high traffic dynamically.

## 7. Trade-offs & Optimizations

- **Consistency vs. Availability:** Prioritizing availability using event-driven architecture but ensuring eventual consistency.
- **SQL vs. NoSQL:** Using SQL for structured data storage and NoSQL (Redis) for real-time location tracking.
- **Load Balancing:** Deploying multiple instances of key services to ensure failover protection.

## 8. Conclusion

This LLD design provides a scalable and efficient approach to handling ride-hailing operations, including sudden demand surges. The design balances real-time performance, system reliability, and ease of extensibility, making it suitable for high-traffic environments like Uber or Lyft.

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Implementing Machine Learning for demand prediction.
- Real-time fraud detection for surge pricing manipulations.
- Multi-modal transportation support (bikes, scooters, etc.).
