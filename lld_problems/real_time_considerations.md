A **SQL database** can handle **real-time changes**, but it must be optimized correctly for accuracy, consistency, and performance. SQL databases provide **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** guarantees, which ensure data accuracy and reliability. However, there are challenges when dealing with **high-frequency real-time updates**, such as tracking vehicle entries and exits in a **parking management system**.

### **Ensuring SQL is Suitable for Real-Time Changes**

1. **Use Optimized Indexing**

   - Index columns like `license_plate`, `entry_time`, and `exit_time` to speed up searches.
   - Use composite indexes for frequent query patterns.

2. **Leverage Transactions**

   - Ensure **atomicity** so that incomplete updates do not cause inconsistent data.

   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE ParkingSpot SET is_occupied = TRUE WHERE spot_id = 'P123' AND is_occupied = FALSE;
   INSERT INTO Ticket (ticket_id, license_plate, entry_time) VALUES ('T001', 'XYZ123', NOW());
   COMMIT;
   ```

   - If any part fails, the transaction is rolled back to prevent **incomplete updates**.

3. **Use Row-Level Locking**

   - Prevents multiple updates on the same spot at the same time.
   - Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to lock rows while updating.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM ParkingSpot WHERE spot_id = 'P123' FOR UPDATE;
   ```

4. **Replication & Read/Write Separation**

   - **Primary DB for Writes:** Handles real-time updates.
   - **Read Replicas:** Serve frequent read queries to reduce the load on the primary DB.

5. **Event-Driven Updates with WebSockets/Kafka**

   - Use **triggers** and **event streaming** for real-time notifications.

   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER notify_on_exit
   AFTER UPDATE ON Ticket
   FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_client();
   ```

6. **Periodic Consistency Checks**

   - Schedule jobs to verify and reconcile discrepancies.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM ParkingSpot p
   LEFT JOIN Ticket t ON p.spot_id = t.spot_id
   WHERE p.is_occupied = TRUE AND t.exit_time IS NOT NULL;
   ```

7. **Use an In-Memory Cache (Redis) for Real-Time Lookups**
   - **Store frequently changing data like available spots in Redis.**
   ```sh
   SET parking_spot_P123 occupied
   ```
   - **Sync back to SQL periodically to maintain persistence.**

### **Trade-Offs**

| Approach          | Pros                      | Cons                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| SQL with indexing | Accurate, ACID guarantees | Can slow down under heavy load |
| Row-level locking | Prevents data corruption  | Increases contention           |
| Replication       | Scales reads efficiently  | Adds replication lag           |
| Redis Cache       | Fast lookups              | Must sync back to SQL          |
| Kafka for Events  | Real-time updates         | Adds complexity                |

### **Conclusion**

Yes, SQL can handle real-time updates **if optimized properly**. **Use indexing, transactions, caching, and event-driven processing** to ensure accuracy and performance. If latency becomes a bottleneck, a **hybrid approach** (SQL + Redis + Kafka) ensures a **scalable, real-time** system.
